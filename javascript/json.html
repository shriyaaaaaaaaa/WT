<!--JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
 It's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications between a server and a client.

Uses of JSON:
Data Exchange: JSON is widely used for exchanging data between a server and a client. For example, when you request data from a server using AJAX, the server often responds with JSON data.

Configuration Files: JSON is often used to store configuration settings for applications.

Data Storage: JSON can be used to store data persistently in databases, files, or other storage systems.

APIs: Many web APIs use JSON as the format for sending and receiving data.

JSON Syntax:
Data is in name/value pairs: "name": "John"
Curly braces hold objects: {"name": "John", "age": 30}
Square brackets hold arrays: {"name": "John", "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling"]}-->

    <h2>JSON Parsing Example</h2>
   <p id="output"></p>

<script>
    // JSON string
    const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling"], "isStudent": false ,"middlename":null}';

    // Parse JSON string into JavaScript object
    const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);

    // Accessing the data
    const output = `
        Name: ${jsonObject.name} <br>
        Age: ${jsonObject.age} <br>
        Hobbies: ${jsonObject.hobbies.join(", ")} <br>
        Is Student: ${jsonObject.isStudent} <br>
        Middlename: ${jsonObject.middlename}
    `;

    // Displaying the parsed data
    document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = output;   
</script>
</body>
</html>

<!--JSON.parse(jsonString): This method parses the JSON string (jsonString) and converts it into a JavaScript object (jsonObject).

Without join(): ["reading", "traveling"] would be displayed as reading,traveling (without spaces).
With join(", "): It is displayed as reading, traveling (with a comma and a space between the items).

Why innerHTML?:
You want to display both the data (Name: ${data.name}, Age: ${data.age}) and HTML structure (e.g., adding <br> for line breaks) inside the <p> element.
    innerHTML is often used when you want to insert or update HTML content within an element on your webpage.-->
